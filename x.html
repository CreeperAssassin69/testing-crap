<p class="lyrics">
New blood joins this earth<br>
And quickly he's subdued<br>
Through constant pained disgrace<br>
The young boy learns their rules<br>
<br>
With time the child draws in<br>
This whipping boy done wrong<br>
Deprived of all his thoughts<br>
The young man struggles on and on he's known<br>
A vow unto his own<br>
That never from this day<br>
His will they'll take away<br><br>
[CHORUS]<br><br>
What I've felt<br>
What I've known<br>
Never shined through in what I've shown<br>
Never be<br>
Never see<br>
Won't see what might have been<br>
<br>
What I've felt<br>
What I've known<br>
Never shined through in what I've shown<br>
Never free<br>
Never me<br>
So I dub thee unforgiven<br>
<br>
They dedicate their lives<br>
To running all of his<br>
He tries to please them all<br>
This bitter man he is<br>
Throughout his life the same<br>
He's battled constantly<br>
This fight he cannot win<br>
A tired man they see no longer cares<br>
The old man then prepares<br>
To die regretfully<br>
That old man here is me<br><br>
[CHORUS]<br><br>
What I've felt<br>
What I've known<br>
Never shined through in what I've shown<br>
Never be<br>
Never see<br>
Won't see what might have been<br>
<br>
What I've felt<br>
What I've known<br>
Never shined through in what I've shown<br>
Never free<br>
Never me<br>
So I dub thee unforgiven<br><br>
[INTERLUDE]<br><br>
What I've felt<br>
What I've known<br>
Never shined through in what I've shown<br>
Never be<br>
Never see<br>
Won't see what might have been<br>
<br>
What I've felt<br>
What I've known<br>
Never shined through in what I've shown<br>
Never free<br>
Never me<br>
So I dub thee unforgiven<br>
<br>
Never free<br>
Never me<br>
So I dub thee unforgiven<br>
<br>
You labeled me<br>
I'll label you<br>
So I dub thee unforgiven<br>
<br>
Never free<br>
Never me<br>
So I dub thee unforgiven<br>
<br>
You labeled me<br>
I'll label you<br>
So I dub thee unforgiven<br>
<br>
Never free<br>
Never me<br>
So I dub thee unforgiven<br><br>
[FADE OUT]<br>
